    <h2>Game Overview</h2>
    <p>Blackjack Royale is a high-stakes card game that blends the core of Blackjack with elements of Poker. You must make a 3-card hand totaling exactly 21, using your hole cards and the revealed community cards. It’s a game of odds, timing, and bluffing that ends in a final showdown with the dealer.</p>

    <h2>Complete Game Rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Each round begins with players placing their initial bets.</li>
      <li>Each player is dealt two hole cards (face down).</li>
      <li>The dealer also receives two cards: one face up and one face down. The dealer cannot see their down card until final reveal.</li>
      <li>Four community cards are revealed one at a time across four betting rounds.</li>
      <li>Players may <strong>Check</strong>, <strong>Call</strong>, <strong>Raise</strong>, or <strong>Fold</strong> between each community card reveal.</li>
      <li>You must build the best 3-card hand totaling 21 using at least one hole card and up to two community cards.</li>
      <li>If you have 21 with your hole cards alone, you may declare a <strong>Blackjack Royale</strong>. The round stops, and others can challenge using all available community cards. If they match or beat your 21, they push or win by hand strength.</li>
      <li>If more than one person reaches 21, compare hand strength using the chart below. Highest strength wins.</li>
      <li>If no player reaches 21, the dealer reveals their down card and attempts to build a 3-card 21 using the same rules.</li>
      <li>If the dealer achieves 21 and players don't, dealer wins the pot.</li>
      <li>If neither dealer nor players hit 21, the closest score under 21 wins.</li>
      <li>Anyone going over 21 busts and is out of the round.</li>
      <li>If everyone hits 21 at once, highest hand strength wins — <strong>no pot splitting</strong>.</li>
      <li>Bluffing, strategy, and betting order can greatly affect the game outcome.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example Scenarios</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Player A declares Blackjack Royale with A♠ + K♠. Player B uses A♦ + 10♣ + Q♥ to challenge and gets 21. Player A wins with stronger hand (100 vs 90).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Dealer has Q♦ face-up, hidden card is 9♠. Final card from community makes 21. Only Player C had 21 before. Player C still wins due to higher score.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Everyone busts except the dealer, who ends with 20. Dealer wins all bets.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>Example 4:</strong> Player X folds after second community card, forfeiting their chips. Player Y raises and wins the round by default when others fold.</p>
